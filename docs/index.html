<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"B Nazanin";margin-top:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify;'><strong>Java 8</strong>, which was launched on March 18, <strong><span style="color:#548235;">2014</span></strong>, introduced several features that were initially planned for Java 7 but were postponed. The development of these features was structured around JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs).</p>
<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"B Nazanin";margin-top:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify;'>One significant addition was the support for <strong><span style="color:#2F5597;">lambda expressions</span>,&nbsp;</strong>also known as closures, and <strong><span style="color:#2F5597;">default methods&nbsp;</span></strong>(virtual extension methods) through Project Lambda. This sparked debates within the Java community, with Sun eventually deciding to include lambda expressions in Java, seeking community feedback to refine the feature. Lambda expressions enabled functional-style operations on collections, like MapReduce-inspired transformations. Default methods allowed API authors to add new methods to interfaces without disrupting existing code, inadvertently enabling multiple inheritance of behavior.</p>
<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"B Nazanin";margin-top:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify;'>Other notable features introduced in Java 8 included Project <span style="color:#2F5597;">Nashorn</span>, a JavaScript runtime for running JavaScript code within applications, support for annotations on Java types, unsigned integer arithmetic, repeating annotations, a new date and time API, statically-linked JNI libraries, direct launching of JavaFX application JARs, and the removal of the permanent generation.</p>
<p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:"B Nazanin";margin-top:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify;'>By October 2014, Java 8 became the default version for download from the official website, replacing Java 9. Oracle committed to providing Public Updates and auto updates of Java SE 8 indefinitely for personal users.</p>
